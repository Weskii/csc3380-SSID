#Super Shark Incubation Device (SSID)

SSID is a simple, virtual pet game developed for the Object-Oriented Design (CSC 3380) course at LSU. Written over a few weeks, it features choice of three virtual shark pets that are fed and clothed by the player. SSID's primary draw is earning virtual currency to spend on your pet by discovering unique SSIDs as you travel in your daily life.

SSID's gameplay and SSID-checking routine were written by Westen Kinnaird and Raphael Mettig. Art assets were provided by Sam Hardy and Megan Owens. Overall design was a group effort.
